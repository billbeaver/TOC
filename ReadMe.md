Version 3.0i - 5 Sept, 2012
* Recompiled for Flex Viewer 3.0 with no locale specified

Version 3.0 - 13 June, 2012
* Recompiled for Flex Viewer 3.0
* Fixed some disableZoomMenu option issues

Version 2.5.1.1 - 7 May, 2012
* Fixed bug with sublayers having a description option when usenewesridescription is true.

Version 2.5.1 - 4 May, 2012
* Fixed bug with loading legend remaining when there is no operational layers or when a WMS layer is used or 
  when a layer fails to load due to some error.
* MAJOR CHANGE when a layer of a map service or the whole mapservice is excluded using the excludelayers it
  is excluded from the TOC and the map. This has changed from where it use to be visible in the map even 
  though it was excluded from the TOC. *Clarification* If you want to exclude a whole map service from the 
  toc and the map then you just remove it from the viewers main config. Currently if you exclude a map service
  and do not specify any sublayers then the mapservice will remain in the map.
* Mapservices are ordered in reverse order of what you have in the main config.xml, just like esri's layerlist
  and map switcher.
* There is a new 'everything' attribute on the tocsettings expanded tag. This forces all layer/sublayer/legends
  to be opened. If you use the everything="true" attribute than the collapselegends is ignored. There are still
  situations where a map service will fail to expand due to some network delay occurring for that map service.
* Individual Layer of a Map Service now have a TOC menu for zooming to its extent.

Version 2.5.0.2 - 23 Mar, 2012
* Added support to mimics esri's concerning hiddenLayers_ being removed automatically from the TOC
* Added support to mimics esri's concerning updating the TOC when programmatic changes to layer visibility is made.

Version 2.5.0.1 - 27 Feb, 2012
* Fixed the issue where featurelayers are always added to the top of the TOC. Now featurelayers are added in
  the exact order that they appear in the config.xml.

Version 2.5 - 12 Dec, 2011
* Added new Flex Viewer 2.5 Layer menu capability to TOC.
* Enhanced the visual appearance of the out of the box Flex Viewer 2.5 Layer options menu and added more options.

* Fix changes to label in xml file not being honored.

Version 2.4.4 - 22 Sept, 2011
* Fix for PictureMarkerSymbols comming from a 10.0 Server.

Version 2.4.3 - 2 Sept, 2011
* Fix for WMS and Image Services constantly displaying the generating legends message.
* Fix for scale dependent layers label not being readable when end user is using white as widget
  background color.

Version 2.4.2 - 1 August, 2011, 8:40 PM
* Fix for the disappearing labels
* TOCWidget now respects what has been set in the MapSwitcherWidget and vise versa.
* Minimal support for KML layers has been added. Legend swatches are not supported yet as the 
  API's support of KMLLayer is not matured yet.
* Uncompiled code is written for Flex Viewer 2.4 ONLY!

Version 2.3.9.2 - 1 August, 2011, 8:40 PM
* This probably will not happen ever again but I wanted to have a good stable Flex Viewer 2.3.1 
  version of this widget available so I have added the compiled version with the memory leak fix 
  and the follow-up fix for the disapearing labels.
* Uncompiled code is written for Flex Viewer 2.4 ONLY!

Version 2.4.1 - 1 August, 2011, 3:10PM
* Fixed memory leak issue
* added back in the 2.3.1 compiled version since I have such a grievous code error, for those that have not yet updated to the Flex Viewer 2.4.
* Fixed issue with REALLY long layer labels and placement of the Details button.

Version 2.4 - 29 July, 2011
* Recompiled for Flex Viewer 2.4

* Fixed a item alignment issue in the TOC

Version 2.3.9 - 12 July, 2011

  message was not be stuck on the widget. (Legend swatches will not be gerated for Server 9.3.1 or lower).

Version 2.3.8.4 - 23 June, 2011
* Slowed down mouse wheel scroll speed
* Added generic legend support for Dimension, Annotation, Raster Catalog, and Tiled Raster Basemaps
* I am not real happy with the Tiled Raster Basemaps but the way esri currently returns legend info
  is not real conducive to legend generation. Maybe 10.1 of server will fix this.

Version 2.3.8.3 - 21 June, 2011

Version 2.3.6 - 8 June, 2011

  of a alert dialog as previous version.
* Whole map services AND/OR INDIVIDUAL layers can be excluded from the TOC.
* The mx tree has about 99 bugs that are unresolved so there are some issues with scrolling the TOC

* Fixed bug with legend getting cut off horizontally if labels are long.

Version 2.3.2 - 21 May, 2011

Version 2.3.1 - 6 May, 2011
* Added support for legend generation whether you have ArcGIS Server 10 or 10 SP1

easier moving of widget to new versions of the Flex Viewer.

and the uncompiled version. Exclude base maps and other options are back again.

  for the widgetclosebuttonskin in the wrong place.

This is just a simple TOC Widget that includes my dynamic legend component.
This widget also includes my enhancement for map service transparency,
right click context menu for zoom to make layer visible, and my scale 
dependent renderer for the TOC checkboxes.

To install using the compiled version just copy the folder called TOC
under the Widgets folder, and add this line to your config.xml

<widget label="Map Contents" x="50" y="100"
				icon="assets/images/i_folder.png"
				config="widgets/TOC/TOCWidget.xml"
				url="widgets/TOC/TOCWidget.swf"/>

For the Uncompiled you need to copy the TOC folder to src/widgets then 
add TOCWidget.mxml to your flex projects modules list, and compile your
project as well as add the widget line above to your config.xml.


Enjoy
